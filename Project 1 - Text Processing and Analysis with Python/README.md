## Project 1 - Text Processing and Analysis with Python

**Summary:**

This project was developed for the course Foundations and Natural Language Processing (FPLN).</br>
It focused on building a Python interface capable of reading, processing, and extracting information from textual files to explore language patterns and analyze website data.</br>
For this project, six recipes were selected from the 24 Kitchen website and saved as .txt files for detailed analysis.</br>
The project was carried out with guidance from Professor José João, who provided support with technical challenges and feedback on the overall approach.

**Main Objectives:**

- Consolidate knowledge from the Natural Language Processing course.
- Develop a Python program capable of processing multiple text files and extracting structured information.
- Implement textual analysis metrics, including word frequency, line count, sentence length, proper nouns, and shared vocabulary.
- Enable exporting of analyzed data in multiple formats (JSON, CSV, XML) for further use.

**Key Features and Tasks:**

- Extracted structured information from .txt files, including recipe title, author, ingredients, and preparation steps.
- Implemented web scraping from the 24 Kitchen website using *requests* and *BeautifulSoup*.
- Calculated word counts, line counts, frequency of user-selected words, top 10 most common words, proper nouns, and average sentence length.
- Identified common words across multiple texts, excluding simple stopwords and numbers.
- Built a terminal-based interactive interface allowing users to select files, run analyses, and export results.

**My Role and Contributions:**

- Developed Python scripts using *re*, *os*, *csv*, *json*, *xml.etree.ElementTree*, *requests*, *BeautifulSoup*, and *Counter*.
- Designed and implemented the main program flow and menu-driven interface for user interaction.
- Created functions for text extraction, analysis, and data export, ensuring modularity and reusability.
- Managed error handling for file access, web requests, and user inputs.

**Learnings and Outcomes:**

- Gained practical experience in Python programming for text processing and web scraping.
- Learned to apply natural language processing techniques to real-world textual data.
- Developed skills in organizing, structuring, and exporting data for further analysis.
- Experienced the benefits of automating text analysis, improving efficiency over manual methods.
- Enhanced understanding of project workflow, from data collection and processing to analysis and reporting.
