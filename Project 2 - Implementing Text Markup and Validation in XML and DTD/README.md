## Project 2 - Implementing Text Markup and Validation in XML and DTD

**Summary:**

A project focused on the digital modeling and markup of *Memorial de Varios Simplices* by Jo√£o Curvo Semmedo, creating structured text documents using XML and defining validation rules with DTD.

**Main Objectives:**

- Understand markup languages and document structuring.
- Apply XML to encode textual data.
- Use DTD for validating document structures.

**Key Features and Tasks:**

- Defined a DTD (Document Type Definition) to structure elements of the work (titles, locus, geoName, citation, foreign, etc.).
- Created an XML document following TEI (Text Encoding Initiative) standards, ensuring compliance with the DTD.
- Inserted metadata in the <teiHeader> (author, title, date, source, and transcription responsibilities).
- Applied semantic markup to key elements such as <drug>, <ingredient>, and <herb> to enable future research and automated analysis.
- Included supporting images (<figure><graphic url="..."/></figure>) to visually contextualize excerpts.
- Structured sample texts in XML and ensured data consistency and proper formatting.

**My Role and Contributions:**

- Wrote XML files and corresponding DTDs.
- Marked up semantic elements to facilitate automated search and analysis.
- Tested validation rules to ensure compliance with schemas.

**Learnings and Outcomes:**

- Learned the principles of document markup, semantic tagging, and validation.
- Understood how structured data and TEI standards enhance readability, research potential, and consistency of historical texts.
