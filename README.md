## Project 1 - Text Processing and Analysis with Python

**Summary:**

This project was developed for the course Foundations and Natural Language Processing (FPLN).</br>
It focused on building a Python interface capable of reading, processing, and extracting information from textual files to explore language patterns and analyze website data.</br>
