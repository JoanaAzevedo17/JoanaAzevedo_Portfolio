### Project  - Educational Mobile App Prototype Designed in Figma

This project showcases an interactive mobile application prototype developed in Figma, inspired by João Curvo Semmedo’s Memorial de Varios Simples.

The concept merges historical and educational dimensions, offering users an immersive experience that bridges the study of medicinal plants and traditional remedies with contemporary interaction design. 

Through quizzes, mini-games, and exploratory features, the app promotes active learning and engagement, illustrating how digital design can reinterpret historical knowledge for modern audiences.
